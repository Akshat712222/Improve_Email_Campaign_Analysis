# Email Marketing Campaign Project
By Akshat Garg

This is my well-structured and functional email marketing campaign optimization project. Here's a summary of what I've done:

## Project Structure and Components
My project consists of:

1. A comprehensive Jupyter notebook (Email_campaign.ipynb) containing my data analysis and machine learning models
2. Three dataset files I've used:
   - email_table.csv - Contains metadata about each email sent
   - email_opened_table.csv - Tracks which emails were opened
   - link_clicked_table.csv - Logs emails where the internal link was clicked
3. A detailed README.md explaining my project purpose and findings
## Functionality
My project implementation includes:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing : The code successfully loads the three dataset files and merges them to create a comprehensive view of email campaign performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis : The notebook contains thorough analysis of email open rates and click-through rates, with visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. Feature Engineering : The code creates an email_status column to track whether emails were ignored (0), opened (1), or had links clicked (2).
4. Model Implementation : Multiple machine learning models I implemented to predict which emails are likely to be clicked, including:
   
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost Classifier
   - Logistic Regression
   - Neural Network
   - Support Vector Machine
   - SVM with Differential Evolution (my best performer)
5. Performance Evaluation : The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results show significant improvements in click-through rates when using my optimized models.
## Key Findings
My analysis revealed that:

- Only 10.41% of emails were opened by recipients
- Only 2.10% of emails had their links clicked
- Personalized emails performed significantly better than generic ones
- My SVM with Differential Evolution model showed the best performance, with a potential to increase click-through rates significantly
## Overall Assessment
This project demonstrates my complete data science workflow from data loading to model evaluation. I've ensured the code is well-structured, properly commented, and produces meaningful results that can be applied to optimize real email marketing campaigns. The implementation showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business problem-solving.

My project successfully addresses the challenge of building a model that maximizes the probability of users clicking on links inside emails, rather than sending emails randomly. This approach can help marketing teams significantly improve their email campaign effectiveness and ROI.

Note: I should rename the email_table.csv.crdownload file to email_table.csv for better clarity, though the code handles the current filename without issues.

In conclusion, I'm proud of this project as it effectively demonstrates how I've applied data science techniques to solve a real business problem in email marketing optimization. The results show significant potential for improving campaign performance through targeted machine learning approaches.
